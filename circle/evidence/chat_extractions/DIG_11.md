# PANHANDLERS DIG EXECUTION — STAGE 1

This is an execution command, not a request for protocol review.

Do not critique, improve, rewrite, summarize, or discuss the extraction protocol.

## HARD SOURCE BOUNDARY

Analyze only the original user-and-assistant messages belonging to this specific historical chat thread. The source corpus begins with the first original conversational message in this thread and ends immediately before this execution command.

Exclude all of the following:

* Project Conversation Content containing summaries or excerpts from other chats;
* memories or generalized knowledge of other discussions;
* uploaded continuity or archive files;
* system and developer context;
* any material whose source anchor belongs to a differently titled conversation.

If the evidence needed for a claim is not present inside this single bounded thread, mark it `UNKNOWN`. If this thread contains no recoverable material for a requested ledger, state that plainly. Do not import material from another conversation to complete the assignment.

If you recognize relevant material from cross-chat context, project memory, or account-level history that is not evidenced inside this bounded thread, do not use it in any ledger or claim. Instead, list it under the final section `7. X-CONTEXT Notices` as a minimal lead: thread title (if identifiable), approximate date, and topic — nothing more. Do not summarize, interpret, or extract from the recalled material; a notice identifies where to dig, it does not perform a second extraction. Example of the correct form: "A related discussion may exist under 'Trust vs Prediction,' approximately June 30. Not evidence for this packet."

Perform **Stage 1 only**:

1. Source and attribution audit
2. Conversation map
3. Dispute-origin analysis
4. Grant position ledger
5. Ziggy position ledger

For each material claim, distinguish:

* **G-DIRECT** — Grant's own words appear in this chat.
* **G-REPORTED** — Ziggy reports or paraphrases something Grant said elsewhere.
* **Z-DIRECT** — Ziggy states his own position directly.
* **NOVA-INTERPRETATION** — the assistant interprets Grant, Ziggy, or the dispute.
* **CO-CONSTRUCTED** — Ziggy and the assistant develop the idea together.
* **UNCLEAR** — attribution cannot be confidently determined.

Do not silently convert G-REPORTED into G-DIRECT. Do not attribute an assistant-generated phrase to Grant or Ziggy unless that person explicitly adopted it.

For every major dispute include:

* Surface Question
* Underlying Question
* Jurisdiction Conflict
* Mutation Point
* Source Anchor

A source anchor must contain the speaker, a unique opening phrase or recoverable wording, and its approximate location in the conversation.

Do not extract or name Museum operators yet.

Do not ask me questions. Mark missing evidence `UNKNOWN`.

# PANHANDLERS DIG EXECUTION — STAGE 2

Continue using the complete conversation and the completed Stage-1 extraction as the source corpus.

The hard source boundary from Stage 1 still applies: only the original user-and-assistant messages of this specific historical thread, plus the completed prior extractions. Exclude Project Conversation Content, summaries or excerpts from other chats, memories, uploaded archive files, and system/developer context. Evidence not present in this bounded thread is `UNKNOWN`. Report any cross-chat recollection as a minimal X-CONTEXT notice at the end of your output (thread title/date/topic only — no interpretation); never use it as evidence.

This is an execution command. Do not critique or improve the protocol.

Perform Museum-blind cognitive extraction. Do not use or mention existing Museum or Circle operator names.

Identify:

1. repeated reasoning moves;
2. consequential one-time moves;
3. operator sequences;
4. offense/defense differences;
5. role-induced behavior;
6. relationship-level interaction loops.

For each proposed move provide:

* Provisional neutral name
* Actor
* Definition
* Trigger
* Operation
* Output
* Productive function
* Failure mode
* Functional Type:
  * TRANSFORMATIVE
  * EXPLORATORY
  * EVALUATIVE
  * REGULATORY / INHIBITORY
  * RHETORICAL
  * PROTOCOL-INDUCED
  * UNKNOWN
* Voluntariness:
  * VOLUNTARY
  * PROMPT-INDUCED
  * ROLE-INDUCED
  * UNCLEAR
* Source Anchor
* Confidence
* Alternative explanation

Do not convert a substantive belief, rhetorical tactic, isolated reaction, or relationship dynamic into an individual cognitive operator without explicitly defending that classification.

Do not ask me questions. Mark missing evidence `UNKNOWN`.

# PANHANDLERS DIG EXECUTION — STAGE 3

This is an execution command, not a request for protocol review.

Do not critique, improve, rewrite, summarize, or discuss the extraction protocol.

Continue using the complete conversation plus the completed Stage-1 and Stage-2 extractions as the source corpus.

The hard source boundary from Stage 1 still applies: only the original user-and-assistant messages of this specific historical thread, plus the completed prior extractions. Exclude Project Conversation Content, summaries or excerpts from other chats, memories, uploaded archive files, and system/developer context. Evidence not present in this bounded thread is `UNKNOWN`. Report any cross-chat recollection as a minimal X-CONTEXT notice at the end of your output (thread title/date/topic only — no interpretation); never use it as evidence.

Perform **Stage 3 only**:

1. **Omission analysis with availability test.** Identify important moves that were available but absent — for example: reconstructing the opposing framework before scoring it; applying the same burden to one's own framework; distinguishing `unknown` from `zero`; temporarily granting a possibility; asking what function a framework serves; clarifying the jurisdiction of a standard; conceding a limited point; testing a conclusion under reversed roles.

   For each claimed omission provide:
   * why the move was relevant at a specific point (with source anchor);
   * **Availability tier:**
     * **A3 — Demonstrated Available:** the actor used the move elsewhere in this conversation.
     * **A2 — Explicitly Available:** the move was offered or requested and declined.
     * **A1 — Contextually Available:** the exchange clearly called for it and a competent participant could reasonably deploy it.
     * **A0 — Unknown:** insufficient basis to claim availability.
   * **Omission classification:** A3/A2 → CONFIRMED INFORMATIVE OMISSION; A1 → POSSIBLE INFORMATIVE OMISSION; A0 → NON-INFORMATIVE (report it, but draw no conclusion from it);
   * whether the absence changed the outcome;
   * whether the absence appears stable or situational.

   Do not treat every unused move as a defect.

2. **Counterevidence search.** For every major Stage-1/Stage-2 characterization, search this conversation for evidence against it — for example: a preserved low-probability possibility; explanation valued independently of prediction; an attractive possibility rejected; strong evidential pruning demanded; a charitable reconstruction; an expected move not deployed. Report null results explicitly ("searched, none found").

3. **Alternative readings.** For each major characterization, state the strongest alternative explanation (substantive belief rather than operator; rhetorical tactic; role effect; protocol-induced behavior; one-off reaction) and what evidence in this conversation discriminates between the readings — or mark `UNKNOWN` if nothing here can.

Do not ask me questions. Mark missing evidence `UNKNOWN`.

Return only:

```text

2. Possible Informative Omissions (A1)

````text
# PANHANDLERS DIG EXECUTION — STAGE 4

This is an execution command, not a request for protocol review.

Do not critique, improve, rewrite, summarize, or discuss the extraction protocol.

Continue using the complete conversation plus the completed Stage-1, Stage-2, and Stage-3 extractions as the source corpus.

The hard source boundary from Stage 1 still applies: only the original user-and-assistant messages of this specific historical thread, plus the completed prior extractions. Exclude Project Conversation Content, summaries or excerpts from other chats, memories, uploaded archive files, and system/developer context. Evidence not present in this bounded thread is `UNKNOWN`. Report any cross-chat recollection as a minimal X-CONTEXT notice at the end of your output (thread title/date/topic only — no interpretation); never use it as evidence.

Only now, map the Stage-2 blind findings onto the named candidate registry below. These are candidates, not predetermined conclusions — a forced match is worse than no match.

Candidate registry (definitions carried inline; you cannot see the source archive):

* **Prediction Sovereignty** — predictive success functions as the highest or final epistemic authority, through which all other forms of success must justify themselves.
* **Universalized Evaluative Jurisdiction** — a standard developed for one class of inquiry is extended into domains where its authority has not been established.
* **Generative Admission Restriction** — certain sources (revelation, tradition, narrative coherence, metaphysical intuition, first-person experience, symbolic compression) are denied authority to generate serious candidate hypotheses before evaluation begins.
* **Unmeasured-to-Zero Conversion** — failure to demonstrate success under the selected instrument is converted into a score of zero rather than unknown / untested / outside jurisdiction.
* **Possibility Compression** — possibilities below a plausibility threshold are treated as functionally irrelevant.
* **Baseline Exemption** — the preferred standard is treated as neutral baseline rather than a framework with its own assumptions, producing asymmetric burden.
* **Reconstruction Bypass** — evaluation begins before the framework has been reconstructed according to its own aims, ontology, and success conditions.
* **Contest-to-Defeat Compression** — a raised objection or unresolved challenge is treated as stronger evidence of defeat than the dialectical situation warrants.
* **Symmetry Testing of Standards** — forcing the evaluating standard to file the same paperwork as the evaluated framework.
* **Contested ≠ Defeated** — explicitly holding an objection open as unresolved rather than decisive.
* **Possibility Preservation** — deliberately keeping low-plausibility possibilities on the map during exploratory inquiry.
* **Cross-Disciplinary Swooping** — importing a structure or distinction from a distant discipline to reframe the live dispute.

For each Stage-2 move give a mapping verdict:

* **MATCHES <name>** — state what matches and what does not;
* **EXTENDS <name>** — a variant; describe the delta;
* **NEW** — no adequate match; keep the provisional neutral name;

and state whether the mapping survives that move's Stage-3 alternative reading.

Then produce final verdicts:

**PROFILE-READY CLAIMS** — only claims meeting ALL of:
* recoverable source anchor;
* survived the Stage-3 counterevidence search and alternative-reading check;
* classification defended (not better explained as rhetoric, role behavior, or protocol-induced behavior);
* confidence stated.

For each include: claim; subject; evidence classification; confidence; source anchor; review condition.

**QUARANTINED CLAIMS** — interesting interpretations below threshold, each with the additional evidence that would promote it.

**EXTRACTION SELF-AUDIT** — where this extraction itself may have erred: priming risk from the candidate registry above; over-pattern-matching; asymmetric charity between participants; places where UNCLEAR was converted into a definite label; anything rushed.

Do not ask me questions. Mark missing evidence `UNKNOWN`.

## ✅ After Stage 4

1. Set **Status** at the top to `COMPLETE` and fill any empty Packet Header fields.
   **Do not touch the four pasted outputs — they are now immutable.**
2. Hand the workbook to P.H. Claude for the filing pass: a separate derived
   synthesis packet is assembled (fifth-artifact rule), source anchors become
   `SOURCE_INDEX.md` entries, Stage-4 PROFILE-READY CLAIMS promote into profiles
   per the protocol's Archive Integration rules. Quarantined claims stay in the
   workbook; only CONFIRMED (A3/A2) omissions can support profile-ready claims.
3. Status becomes `FILED` once promotion is done and logged in `INDEX.md`.
