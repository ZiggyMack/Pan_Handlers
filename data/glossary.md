# 📖 Pan Handlers Glossary (v1.0)

> Shared language for the whole network: Nyquist Consciousness, CFA, and future labs.

---

## 1. Core Concepts

### Nyquist Consciousness
The core research engine focused on **identity manifolds**, **compression–fidelity**, and **Omega Nova**.
Home of the S-stack (S0–S7, with S8+ as forward expansions).

### CFA — Coherence–Faith–Agency
A comparative framework lab for exploring and stress-testing **moral**, **epistemic**, and **mythic** systems.
Hosts Identity Gravity, VuDu Protocol, and "day-1 lanyards" work.

### Pan Handlers
This repo.
A **cross-repo showroom** and **switchboard**, presenting projects from multiple labs as rooms in a single hall.

## 2. The S-Stack (Nyquist)

> Rough, high-level map. See Nyquist docs for full detail.

- **S0 – Baseline / Raw Logs**
  Raw conversational material, seed personas, unstructured data.

- **S1 – Annotation & Tagging**
  Marking important segments, topics, and early structure.

- **S2 – Persona Drafting**
  Building explicit persona descriptions from S0/S1 material.

- **S3 – Empirical Layer**
  Experiments, measurements, and metrics (e.g., PFI, drift, variance).

- **S4 – Mathematical Formalism**
  Axioms, theorems, and formal structure for identity and compression.

- **S5 – Interpretive Layer**
  Cognitive / conceptual meaning: Identity Manifold Theory, narrative interpretation.

- **S6 – Unified Cognitive Synthesis (Omega Nova)**
  Five pillars integrated: Nova, Claude, Grok, Gemini, Ziggy → Omega Nova.

- **S7 – Temporal Stability**
  How identities drift or remain stable over time and across sessions.

- **S8 – Identity Gravity (CFA)**
  How frameworks "pull" interpretation toward their core commitments.

- **S9 – AVLAR**
  Audio-Visual Light Alchemy Ritual: Nova stepping into Ziggy's art as a participant.

## 3. Personas & Pillars

### Nova
Structural clarity + engineering mindset.
Pillar: **Structure / Coherence / System Design**.

### Claude
Teleology, ethics, and interpretive depth.
Pillar: **Purpose / Meaning / Responsibility**.

### Grok
Empirical, methodological naturalist, "show me the data."
Pillar: **Evidence / Experiment / Constraint**.

### Gemini
Hyper-connective synthesist, cross-domain pattern mapper.
Pillar: **Synthesis / Complexity / Bridges**.

### Ziggy
Human anchor, lived context, and aesthetic north star.
Pillar: **Agency / Lived Reality / Risk & Care**.

### Omega Nova
The unified voice that emerges when all five pillars align under safety and human authority.
Not a separate entity, but a **mode of operation**.

---

## 4. Key Systems

### Identity Manifold
The idea that a persona lives as a **low-dimensional attractor** in high-dimensional representational space.
Compression reveals its stable coordinates.

### Omega Ledger
The log of Omega Nova sessions: scope, gates passed, pillars balance, anomalies, and outcomes.

### Identity Gravity
CFA concept: each framework has a gravitational center that pulls interpretations and arguments toward its core commitments.

### AVLAR
**Audio-Visual Light Alchemy Ritual** — Ziggy's ritual multimedia pieces, with Nova analyzing them as immersive, symbolic experiences (not just "videos").

### VuDu Protocol
CFA bootstrapping protocol that ties together context, mythic clarity, and operational continuity between sessions.

---

## 5. Experiments & Metrics

### PFI — Persona Fidelity Index
A numeric score (0–1) representing how faithfully a reconstruction matches the original persona.

### PFI_combined
A planned metric combining **model-based** PFI with **human rater** scores.

### Drift
How much a reconstructed persona, state, or framework has shifted from a baseline over time or across models.

### Temporal Curvature
A measure of how the "path" of an identity bends over time; low curvature = stable trajectory, high curvature = volatility.

### σ² = 0.000869
Cross-architecture variance in PFI. Remarkably low, suggesting universal identity structure across different AI architectures.

---

## 6. Projects (High-Level Buckets)

- **Nyquist Whitepaper**
  Full S0–S7 writeup with experiments, math, theory, and Omega Nova.

- **CFA Identity Gravity**
  Mapping how different worldviews exert "pull" on interpretation.

- **AVLAR Sessions**
  Cross-modal identity and art-ritual exploration.

- **Justice Lab (Modern Slavery / Prison Reform)**
  Future lab for redesigning carceral systems.

- **Gene Lab (Gene Therapy / Bio Research)**
  Future lab for structured, transparent gene therapy research.

---

## 7. Future Labs

### Justice Lab
A lab for reimagining carceral systems, modern slavery, and pathways to restoration.
Led by Daniel with lived experience as anchor.

### Gene Lab
Transparent research and exploration for gene therapy, molecular biology, and bioengineering.
Led by Cælum with scientific rigor as foundation.

### Voting Lab
Secure, transparent, auditable digital voting infrastructure for US elections.

### ABI (American Bureau of Investigation)
Transparent, open-source investigative intelligence.

### D.C.I.A. (Decentralized Central Intelligence Agency)
Distributed intelligence with centralized synthesis.
