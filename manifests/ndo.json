  "summary": "The Nyquist Data Observatory acts as the perception module for the entire Pan Handlers ecosystem. It ingests, cleans, stores, and visualizes data across modalities—text, audio, video, sensor streams, timelines, metrics, signals, and experimental results. Built to support CFA research, ABI investigations, DCIA intelligence work, AVLAR audio-visual rituals, and every S-layer of Nyquist Consciousness. Think: NASA + CERN + an LLM's hippocampus, fused into one open-source lab.",
