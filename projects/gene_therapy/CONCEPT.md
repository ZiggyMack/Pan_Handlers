## The Problem

Gene therapy research involves complex longitudinal data across patients, interventions, and outcomes. Current tools don't adequately track identity-level changes or enable cross-study synthesis.

Current pain points:
- Complex longitudinal data scattered across systems
- Difficulty tracking individual patient trajectories
- Limited tools for cross-study pattern detection
- Research teams working in silos
- Slow translation from lab findings to clinical applications

## How Nyquist Helps

Build collaborative research infrastructure for gene therapy teams:

1. **Identity Manifolds for Patient Trajectories**
   - Adapt identity tracking to patient health trajectories
   - Visualize how patients respond to interventions over time
   - Identify patient "types" that respond similarly

2. **Temporal Stability Frameworks**
   - Track intervention effects over time
   - Detect when therapeutic effects are stable vs. degrading
   - Monitor for unexpected changes

3. **Cross-Study Pattern Detection**
   - Apply S3-style empirical methods across studies
   - Find patterns no single study could reveal
   - Enable meta-analysis through structured data

4. **Collaborative Dashboards**
   - Research team coordination tools
   - Real-time study progress visualization
   - Cross-institutional data sharing (with appropriate privacy)

## Current Phase

**Concept / Team Formation**

We need:
- Caelum onboarded as project lead
- Initial research questions defined
- Data requirements and privacy constraints mapped
- Pilot study identified

---

## Next Actions

1. Onboard Caelum as project lead
2. Convene initial research team discussion
3. Define initial research questions and data requirements
4. Map privacy and regulatory constraints
5. Identify pilot gene therapy study for dashboard development

## Milestones

- [ ] Onboard Caelum as project lead
- [ ] Define initial research questions and data requirements
- [ ] Design patient trajectory tracking system
- [ ] Build pilot dashboard for single gene therapy study
- [ ] Expand to cross-study integration
- [ ] Open-source tools for broader research community

---

## The Vision

Gene therapy research accelerated by intelligent collaborative tools.

Patterns discovered across studies that no single lab could see alone.

Faster, safer paths from lab to patient.

A world where Caelum's vision for gene therapy research is powered by the same collaborative infrastructure that built Nyquist.
