# Online Voting System for US Elections

**Status:** Concept
**Track:** Governance / Democracy
**Owner:** Ziggy + community

## The Problem

US election infrastructure is archaic, inaccessible, and lacks real-time transparency.

Current pain points:
- Physical polling places create barriers for many voters
- Mail-in voting is slow and contested
- No real-time transparency into vote tallies
- Voting systems are black boxes that breed mistrust
- Election results take days to verify
- Accessibility issues for disabled voters

Citizens deserve voting systems as modern and trustworthy as their banking apps.

## How Nyquist Helps

Design a modern online voting system focused on transparency, auditability, and user experience:

1. **Identity Verification**
   - Manifold-based authentication approaches
   - Multi-factor verification without friction
   - Privacy-preserving identity confirmation

2. **Temporal Stability Tracking**
   - Detect anomalous voting patterns in real-time
   - Monitor for systematic irregularities
   - Track vote flow for audit trails

3. **Transparency Dashboards**
   - Real-time vote tallies (appropriately aggregated)
   - Cryptographic proof your vote was counted
   - Public audit logs

4. **Cross-Validation Frameworks**
   - Multiple independent verification systems
   - Cryptographic consensus on vote counts
   - Distributed verification preventing single points of failure

## Technical Approach

### Phase 1: UX and Look-and-Feel
- Design modern, accessible voting interface
- Mobile-first design (voting as easy as banking)
- Accessibility for all users (screen readers, large text, etc.)

### Phase 2: Cryptographic Backend
- Zero-knowledge proofs for vote verification
- Blockchain or distributed ledger for immutability
- End-to-end encryption with verifiable counting

### Phase 3: Integration and Pilot
- Partner with local election officials
- Pilot in low-stakes elections first
- Scale based on proven security

## Current Phase

**Concept / Design**

We need:
- Research into cryptographic voting protocols
- UI/UX mockups for voter experience
- Security architecture design
- Partnerships with election security experts

---

## Next Actions

1. Research existing secure voting protocols (zero-knowledge proofs, blockchain voting)
2. Design voter authentication UX mockups
3. Consult with cryptographic security experts
4. Identify potential pilot election opportunities

---

## Milestones

- [ ] Research existing secure voting protocols
- [ ] Design voter authentication UX
- [ ] Build demo voting dashboard for local elections
- [ ] Partner with election security experts for cryptographic backend
- [ ] Pilot in local/primary election
- [ ] **GOAL: Live data for next general election**

---

## The Vision

Every US citizen can vote securely from their phone, with full transparency into vote tallies and cryptographic proof their vote was counted.

Elections become accessible, auditable celebrations of democracy rather than anxious logistical nightmares.

A world where "election fraud" accusations can be definitively addressed with mathematical proof, not political rhetoric.
