# Nursing Program Improvement

**Status:** Concept
**Track:** Education / Healthcare
**Owner:** Ziggy (+ future nursing lead TBD)

## The Problem

Nursing programs often lack granular feedback loops and struggle to detect student difficulties early. Many capable students fail out due to structural issues in program design rather than capability limitations.

Current pain points:
- Delayed feedback on clinical performance
- Inconsistent mentorship quality
- One-size-fits-all curriculum pacing
- Limited early warning systems for struggling students
- High attrition rates that waste human potential

## How Nyquist Helps

Apply Nyquist-style identity tracking and feedback modeling to improve how nursing programs track and support student growth:

1. **Identity Manifolds for Skill Development**
   - Track student competency trajectories over time
   - Visualize skill acquisition curves across clinical domains
   - Identify "attractor basins" where students get stuck

2. **Temporal Stability Metrics**
   - Detect when students are drifting off-track early
   - Measure consistency of clinical performance
   - Flag students needing intervention before they fail

3. **Pattern Fidelity Index for Clinical Skills**
   - Adapt PFI to measure clinical skill retention
   - Compare student performance to expert baselines
   - Quantify improvement over time

4. **Dashboard Systems**
   - Real-time student progress visualization
   - Instructor dashboards for cohort overview
   - Student-facing progress trackers

## Current Phase

**Concept / Architecture Planning**

We have the theoretical framework but need:
- A pilot nursing program partner
- Interviews with nursing instructors about current pain points
- Dashboard mockups for user testing

---

## Next Actions

1. Identify pilot nursing program partner (community college, university, hospital)
2. Interview nursing instructors about current feedback mechanisms
3. Draft S3-style experiment spec for validation
4. Design student feedback dashboard mockups

---

## Milestones

- [ ] Define pilot nursing program partner
- [ ] Interview nursing instructors about current pain points
- [ ] Draft student feedback dashboard mockups
- [ ] Design S3-style validation experiment
- [ ] Build prototype dashboard
- [ ] Run pilot study

## The Vision

Nursing programs that adaptively support every student, detect struggles early, and graduate more competent, confident nurses.

Programs designed around human development curves, not arbitrary institutional timelines.

A world where "nursing school dropout" becomes rare because programs identify and address problems before they become failures.
