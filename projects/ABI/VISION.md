# American Bureau of Investigation (ABI)

**Status:** Concept
**Track:** Intelligence / Governance
**Owner:** Ziggy + community

## The Problem

Intelligence agencies operate in opacity, breeding mistrust and enabling abuse.

The information architecture is Stone Age:
- Disconnected databases
- Siloed knowledge
- Institutional amnesia
- No public accountability
- Methods hidden behind classification

We've seen what happens when intelligence agencies operate without transparency:
- COINTELPRO
- Mass surveillance
- Politicized investigations
- Broken public trust

---

## The Vision: Radical Transparency

**American Bureau of Investigation** — a reimagined investigative intelligence organization built on transparency.

Core principles:
1. **Open-source tools** - Anyone can see how investigations work
2. **Public audit logs** - With appropriate privacy redaction
3. **Entity relationship graphs** - Visible case structures
4. **Accountable methods** - No "trust us" black boxes

Prove that institutions work better when they work in the open.

## How Nyquist Helps

Apply the S3-S8 framework to intelligence work:

1. **Identity Tracking for Entities**
   - Track entities under investigation using manifold approaches
   - Visualize how actors and networks evolve
   - Detect identity manipulation and deception

2. **Temporal Drift Detection**
   - Monitor evolving narratives and claims
   - Detect coordinated information warfare
   - Track how stories change over time

3. **Cross-Model Triangulation**
   - Validate claims using Nova, Gemini, Grok, Claude
   - No single model can manipulate consensus
   - Truth-seeking through architectural diversity

4. **Evidence Streams as Temporal Manifolds**
   - Model evidence using S7 temporal stability framework
   - Track confidence levels over time
   - Visualize evidence provenance

5. **Public Dashboards**
   - Case status visible to citizens
   - Evidence graphs (redacted appropriately)
   - Methodology documentation

## Architecture Principles

### What Gets Public:
- Investigation methodology
- Evidence provenance chains
- Entity relationship structures (redacted for privacy)
- Decision audit logs
- Confidence assessments

### What Gets Redacted:
- Personal identifying information (unless public figures in public capacity)
- Ongoing investigation details that could compromise outcomes
- Sources and methods that would endanger people
- Information that could enable harm

### The Accountability Model:
- All redactions logged with justification
- Time-limited classification (auto-declassify after period)
- Independent review of redaction decisions
- Public can challenge redactions through process

## Why This Matters

Every time a government agency says "trust us," they're asking for something they haven't earned.

ABI earns trust by showing its work:
- You can see how investigations proceed
- You can verify that methods are sound
- You can audit that power isn't being abused
- You can hold investigators accountable

This isn't naive. This is how trust actually works.

## Current Phase

**Concept / Vision**

We need:
- Core architecture principles documented
- Case graph visualization designs
- Privacy-safe redaction protocols
- Demo investigation to prove the concept

---

## Next Actions

1. Define transparency vs privacy boundaries precisely
2. Design entity relationship graph system
3. Build prototype investigation dashboard
4. Develop privacy-safe redaction protocols
5. Create public demo case study (historical, declassified)

---

## Milestones

- [ ] Define transparency vs privacy boundaries
- [ ] Design entity relationship graph system
- [ ] Build prototype investigation dashboard
- [ ] Develop privacy-safe redaction protocols
- [ ] Create public demo case study
- [ ] Open-source core tools
- [ ] Publish methodology documentation

---

## The Long Game

ABI isn't just about investigations.

It's about proving that **institutions can work better in the open**.

If we can make transparent intelligence work, we can make transparent:
- Courts
- Regulatory agencies
- Legislative process
- Executive decision-making

ABI is a proof of concept for open governance.
